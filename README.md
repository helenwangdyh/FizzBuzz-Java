# FizzBuzz-Java

A classic programming game which works as follows: Several people get in a circle and count off numbers sequentially (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4,...). Before counting, two numbers are selected: a “Fizz” number(let’s call it f) and a “Buzz” number (let’s call it b). When counting off, the player must say “Fizz” for numbers divisible by f, and “Buzz” for numbers divisible by b. Numbers divisible by both f and b must be substituted with “FizzBuzz”. The game goes around the circle until someone messes up.

This program gets values f and b from the user, and then prints out numbers substituting “Fizz”, “Buzz”, and “FizzBuzz” as described above. The user also gets to pick the numbers at which to start and end counting. The program quits when either f or b is zero.
